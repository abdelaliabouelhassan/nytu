          <p class="main-text">
            Privent is a software-as-a-service provider for the management of
            events and the processing of ticket sales. Ticket purchasers
            (hereinafter "ticket Purchasers") can purchase tickets for events,
            among other things, via the sales channel described in Clause 1.2.
            Privent enables the direct conclusion of a contract between the
            event organizer and the ticket purchaser.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The subject of these GTC is the use of services that Privent
            provides to ticket purchasers via the web platform (accessible at
            "privent.ch"). which takes place as a stand-alone platform, but also
            as a form integrated into external websites. The agreement to these
            GTC is made by using the corresponding services.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The use of personal data is regulated in the privacy policy. The
            privacy policy is an integral and binding part of these GTC.
          </p>
          <h2 id="vertragsabschluss" class="title">2. Contract conclusion</h2>
          <p class="main-text">
            Privent AG acts in the sense of Art. 20 para. 2 VAT Act as a direct
            proxy and represents the designated organizer. Thus, the party
            represented by Privent AG is deemed to be the service provider
            vis-à-vis the service recipient.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            For the purchase of a ticket and the resulting contract, the
            required personal data must be truthfully provided by the ticket
            purchaser. Furthermore, the provision of a valid e-mail address that
            can be accessed by the ticket purchaser is mandatory. This ensures
            that registration and/or order confirmations can be sent correctly.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The organizer is entitled to print this data on the tickets. Only
            the person named on the ticket will be admitted to the booked event.
            If a purchaser books tickets for more than one person, he must
            ensure that the personal details of all persons are provided
            completely and truthfully.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The contract between the ticket purchaser and the organizer is only
            concluded once the tickets have been made available to the ticket
            purchaser via the platform or sent to him by e-mail.
          </p>
          <h2 id="ticketzustellung" class="title">3. Ticket delivery</h2>
          <p class="main-text">
            Tickets are delivered exclusively in digital form. Purchased tickets
            will be shown to the ticket purchaser immediately after purchase and
            will also be delivered to the previously defined e-mail.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The ticket Purchaser is obliged to check the Tickets immediately
            upon receipt. In the case of personalized tickets, the Ticket Seller
            is in particular obliged to check whether the personalized details
            printed on them are correct.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            If the ticket Purchaser does not have access to the purchased
            Tickets either in the platform or by e-mail after the purchase,
            he/she must contact the telephone number or e-mail published on the
            Privent website within 3 working days.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The ticket purchaser is responsible for the safekeeping of the
            tickets until the event.
          </p>
          <h2 id="gueltigkeit" class="title">4. Validity</h2>
          <p class="main-text">
            A ticket gains its validity only upon Privent’s full receipt of the
            total amount defined in the contract. A ticket issued but not paid
            for will result in rejection at the event access control.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Unless otherwise requested by the organizer on the platform or the
            ticket, the ticket is valid in digital and printed form.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The organizer is entitled to explicitly request the ticket in
            printed form. The ticket must then be printed on white DIN A4 paper.
            It is the responsibility of the ticket purchaser to ensure that he
            has the necessary technical equipment for this.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            In any case, the ticket purchaser must ensure that the printed QR
            code is unchanged and legible. If the QR code cannot be read
            correctly due to damage or falsification, there is no entitlement to
            admission to the event.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The organizer may refuse admission to the event if several
            printouts, duplicates, copies or imitations of a ticket are in
            circulation and a holder of a printout, copy or imitation of the
            respective ticket has already been granted admission to the event.
            In particular, the organizer is not obliged to verify the identity
            of the ticket holder with the ticket purchaser or to verify the
            authenticity of the ticket. If a ticket holder is rejected for this
            reason on the occasion of the access control, there is no claim to
            reimbursement of the fee.

            Saferpay (www.saferpay.com). It is at the discretion of the
            organizer which payment methods are available. After successful
            debiting of the specified means of payment, the ticket purchased for
            it becomes valid.

          <p class="main-text">
            If permitted by the organizer, tickets can be paid for by QR
            invoice. Only the QR code generated for this purpose may be used for
            payment.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The ticket purchaser binds himself to the resulting contract with
            the order. However, the tickets become valid only upon Privent’s
            receipt of full payment of the total amount.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Unless otherwise defined in the contract, payment for the ticket is
            due within 7 days of purchase, but no later than two days before the
            event.

            organizer. Therefore, the organizer alone decides on the
            possibility, the conditions and the processing of a return and
            refund or an exchange of purchased tickets for events, but in no
